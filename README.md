# DAND-project-3
## Analyze A-B Test Results

#### Exploring US Bikeshare Data
Here, goal is to conduct A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new wepage.

##### Overview
The project used data hosted on Udacity.

Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy

##### Key Findings
A/B Testing: The conversion rate for the new page was not better than the the old page.
Hypothesis & Regression Testing: None of the explanatory variables in the model has significant p_value (all are greater than 0.05) so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (Old page recieved same same or more clicks than New page) and conclude that we don't have sufficient evidence to infer that new page drives more conversions than the old page.
